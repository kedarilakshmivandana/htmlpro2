          <center><b>Nobita Nobi</b> is a ten-year-old Japanese school boy, <b>who is kind-hearted and honest, but also lazy, unlucky, weak, gets bad grades and is bad at sports.</b> One day, a robot cat from the 22nd century named <b>Doraemon is sent back to the past by Nobita's future grandchild, Sewashi Nobi, to take care of Nobita </b>so that his descendants can have a better life.<b> Doraemon has a four-dimensional pouch in which he stores tools, inventions, and gadgets from the future to aid Nobita whenever he is faced with a problem.</b> Although Doraemon is a cat robot, he has a fear of mice because of an incident where robotic mice chewed off his ears. <b>This is why Doraemon lost his origin</b>al yellow color and turned blue, from sadness.

          <p>Nobita has three main friends: <b>Takeshi Goda (nicknamed Gian), Suneo Honekawa (Gian's sidekick), and Shizuka Minamoto,</b> Nobita's best friend and love-interest.<b> Gian is a strong,</b> leading and domineering boy, but also loyal to his friends.<b> Suneo is a wealthy and spoiled boy who uses his friendship with Gian</b> to win the respect of other schoolmates.<b> Shizuka is a gentle and kind girl who frequently plays with Nobita.</b> Nobita has a crush on Shizuka; she is his prospective future wife (Nobita's future wife is initially Gian's younger sister).<b> Although Gian and Suneo are Nobita's friends, </b>they also typically bully and abuse him. Nobita normally responds by using Doraemon's gadgets to fight back against them, but Nobita has a tendency to get carried away with using the gadgets (or Gian and Suneo, if they steal it away), which typically results in unintended consequences for him and others.
          <p><b>In addition to Gian, Suneo, and Shizuka, Dorami and Hidetoshi Dekisugi (common name Dekisugi) are also recurring characters.</b><b> Dorami is Doraemon's younger sister,</b> and <b>Dekisugi is a gifted student boy who as Shizuka's close friend, </b>frequently attracts the jealousy of Nobita.

          <p> <center>Doraemon is written and illustrated by <b>Fujiko F. Fujio, the pen name of Japanese manga artist Hiroshi Fujimot</b>. According to Fujio, it was originally conceived following a series of three events: when searching for ideas for a new manga,<b> he wished a machine existed that would come up with ideas for him,</b> he tripped over his daughter's toy, and heard cats fighting in his neighborhood. To set up the plot and characters, <b>he inspired some elements from his earlier manga series, Obake no Q-Tar≈ç, which involve an obake living with humans, with a similar formula.</b> Fujio said that the idea for <b>Doraemon came after "an accumulation of trial and error",</b> during which he finally found the most suitable style of manga to him.[8] Initially, the series achieved little success as gekiga was well-known at the time, and only became a hit after its adaptation into an anime TV series and multiple feature films.[7]

          </center></p>
          <p><center><b>Doraemon is mainly aimed at children,</b> so Fujio chose to create the character with a simple graphic style, based on shapes such as circles and ellipses.He used the same sequences of cartoons with regularity and continuity to enhance the reader's ease of understanding. In addition, blue, a characteristic color of Doraemon, was chosen as the main color in magazine publications, which used to have a yellow cover and red title. Set in Tokyo,<b> the manga reflected parts of Japan's society, such as the class system and the "ideal" of Japanese childhood.</b> Problems, if occur, were resolved in a way so as not to rely on violence and eroticism,and the stories were integrated with the concept of environmentalism.<b>The manga also insisted on the ethical values of integrity, perseverance, courage, family and respect.</b>
