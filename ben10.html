    <h1><center>About!</center></h1>
    <p>Ben 10 is an American media franchise created by Man of Action Studios, produced by Cartoon Network Studios and owned by Warner Bros. Discovery. The series centers on a boy named Ben Tennyson who acquires the Omnitrix, an alien device resembling a wristwatch, which contains DNA of different alien species. Using the Omnitrix, Ben can transform into powerful aliens with various abilities. The Omnitrix initially contains ten aliens, although later on Ben obtains more species by adding and unlocking their DNA.
        The Ben 10 franchise has received widespread critical acclaim, winning 3 Emmy Awards. It consists primarily of 5 television series and 5 films, the latter of which aired between August 2007 and October 2020. Spanning over 16 years, it is Cartoon Network's longest-running franchise to date. There is also a Ben 10 toy line manufactured by Bandai for the first four shows and Playmates Toys for the reboot. Worldwide, the franchise has grossed over $6 billion in retail sales.[1]

        On February 17, 2021, it was announced that three 44-minute specials based on the series would premiere in April 2021: titled Ben 10,010, Ben Gen 10 and Alien X-Tinction, serving as the series finale to the 2016 reboot and a crossover between the first four television series in the franchise.[2]

<center><h1>Elements of the franchise</h1></center>
<hr>
<center>
    <b>Omnitrix!</b>
</center>
<p>The Omnitrix, its Ultimatrix replacement, and the "finalized" version that is the New Omnitrix are the central elements of the Ben 10 story. They are all wristwatch-styled devices developed by the Galvan inventor Azmuth that transforms the user into any one of many alien beings (originally 1,000,906, but the number has increased by 9 via scanning additional species not originally in the database). Despite many seeing the Omnitrix as a weapon, its true purpose was to allow the beings of the universe to understand each other and to resurrect intelligent species that may go extinct.

    The Omnitrix appears in the first two incarnations of the franchise (Ben 10 and Ben 10: Alien Force), but Ben had to destroy it and use the Ultimatrix in the Ultimate Alien series. The Ultimatrix had most of the same functionality as the Omnitrix, but would allow the user to transform the alien into its Ultimate Form (how the species and its DNA would evolve in a one-million-year simulation). In the final episode of Ultimate Alien, Azmuth takes the Ultimatrix from Ben and replaces it with the New Omnitrix – the original version has been a prototype.
    In Ben 10: Omniverse, the Nemetrix, a knock-off of the original Omnitrix, is introduced. Unlike the Omnitrix and its succeeding models, the Nemetrix uses the DNA of the natural predators of sentient alien races which have the sole purpose of hunting Ben. Thus, only an animal can use the Nemetrix, as users of higher intelligence are unable to use it without incurring mental damage. In Omniverse, Albedo recreates the Ultimatrix by using a Polymorphic Crystal to stabilize his transformations, making it so that he can stay in any form as long as he wants. It also allows him to transform into the Ultimate Forms of his aliens without first turning into their normal forms.

In the Reboot series, Ben's Omnitrix can augment enhancements onto his aliens. In Season 2, his aliens can become "Omni-Enhanced" with rock-like constructs and energy. However, the enhancements seems to happen at random. This energy is later revealed to be coming from a new alien species in his Omnitrix, which eventually gets its own form, "Shock Rock". In Season 4, Ben unlocks the "Omni-Kix" feature, which allows him to add armor plating onto his aliens. The Reboot series also introduces the Antitrix, which is wielded by Kevin Levin. The Antitrix allows Kevin to transform into 11 aliens, most of which are ones that Ben has used before, but significantly altered from Ben's version.
