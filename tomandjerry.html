   <p><b>Tom and Jerry is an American animated media franchise and series of comedy short films created in 1940 by William Hanna and Joseph Barbera.</b> Best known for its 161 theatrical short films by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, the series centers on the rivalry between the titular characters of a cat named <b>Tom and a mouse named Jerry.</b> Many shorts also feature several recurring characters.
</p>
<p>
    In its original run, <b>Hanna and Barbera</b> produced 114 Tom and Jerry shorts for MGM from 1940 to 1958. <b>During this time, they won seven Academy Awards for Best Animated Short Film,</b> tying for first place with Walt Disney's Silly Symphonies with the most awards in the category. After the MGM cartoon studio closed in 1957, MGM revived the series with Gene Deitch directing an additional 13 Tom and Jerry shorts for Rembrandt Films from 1961 to 1962. <b>Tom and Jerry then became the highest-grossing animated short film series of that time, overtaking Looney Tunes.</b> Chuck Jones then produced another 34 shorts with Sib Tower 12 Productions between 1963 and 1967. Five more shorts were produced, The Mansion Cat in 2001, The Karate Guard in 2005, A Fundraising Adventure in 2014, and On a Roll and The House That Cat Built in 2021, making a total of 166 shorts.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Tom (named "Jasper" in his debut appearance) is a gray and white domestic shorthair cat.</b> ("Tom" is a generic name for a male cat.) He is usually but not always, portrayed as living a comfortable, or even pampered life, <b>while Jerry (whose name is not explicitly mentioned in his debut appearance) is a small, brown house mouse who always lives in close proximity to Tom.</b> Despite being very energetic, determined and much larger, Tom is no match for Jerry's wits. <b>Jerry also possesses surprising strength </b>for his size, approximately the equivalent of Tom's, lifting items such as anvils with relative ease and withstanding considerable impacts.<b> Although cats typically chase mice to eat them,</b> it is quite rare for Tom to actually try to eat Jerry, but only to hurt or compete with him as usual in a more intimidating strategy to just taunt Jerry (even as revenge), and even to obtain a reward from a human (including his owner(s)/master(s)) for catching Jerry, or for generally doing his job greatly as a house cat.<b> By the final "fade-out" of each cartoon, Jerry usually gets the best of Tom.</b></p>
<p>
    However, other results may be reached. On rare occasions,<b>Tom triumphs, usually when Jerry becomes the aggressor or he pushes Tom a little too far.</b> In The Million Dollar Cat Jerry learns that Tom will lose his newly acquired wealth if he harms any animal, especially mice; he then torments Tom a little too much until he retaliates. In Timid Tabby Tom's look-alike cousin pushes Jerry over the edge. <b>Occasionally and usually ironically, they both lose, usually because Jerry's last trap or attack on Tom backfires on him or he overlooks something.</b> In Chuck Jones' Filet Meow, Jerry orders a shark from the pet store to scare Tom away from eating a goldfish. Afterward, the shark scares Jerry away as well. Finally, they occasionally end up being friends, although, within this set of stories, there is often a last-minute event that ruins the truce.<b> One cartoon that has a friendly ending is Snowbody Loves Me.</b>
</p>
<p>
   <b> Both characters display sadistic tendencies,</b> in that they are equally likely to take pleasure in tormenting each other, although it is often in response to a triggering event. However, when <b>one character appears to truly be in mortal danger from an unplanned situation or due to actions by a third party, the other will develop a conscience and save him.</b> Occasionally, they bond over a mutual sentiment towards an unpleasant experience and their attacking each other is more play than serious attacks.<b> Multiple shorts show the two getting along with minimal difficulty,</b> and they are more than capable of working together when the situation calls for it, usually against a third party who manages to torture and humiliate them both. <b>Sometimes this partnership is forgotten quickly when an unexpected event happens, or when one character feels that the other is no longer necessary.</b> This is the case in Posse Cat, when they agree that Jerry will allow himself to be caught if Tom agrees to share his reward dinner, but Tom then reneges. Other times, however, Tom does keep his promise to Jerry and the partnerships are not quickly dissolved after the problem is solved.

<h2><u><center>Tom & Jerry Speaking:</center></u></h2>
<p>
    Although many supporting and minor characters speak, Tom and Jerry rarely do so themselves. One exception is The Lonesome Mouse where they speak several times briefly, primarily Jerry, to contrive to get Tom back into the house. Tom more often sings while wooing female cats; for example, Tom sings Louis Jordan's "Is You Is or Is You Ain't My Baby" in the 1946 short Solid Serenade. <b>In that short and Zoot Cat, Tom woos female cats using a deep, heavily French-accented voice in imitation of then-popular leading man, actor Charles Boyer.</b> At the end of The Million Dollar Cat, after beginning to antagonize<b> Jerry he says, "Gee, I'm throwin' away a million dollars... BUT I'M HAPPY!" In Tom and Jerry: The Magic Ring, Jerry says, "No, no, no, no, no." when choosing the shop to remove his ring.</b> In The Mouse Comes to Dinner, Tom speaks to his girlfriend Toots while inadvertently sitting on a stove: "Say, what's cookin'?", to which Toots replies "You are, stupid." Another instance of speech comes in Solid Serenade and The Framed Cat, where Tom directs Spike through a few dog tricks in a dog-trainer manner. In Puss Gets the Boot Jerry prays for his life when Tom catches him by the tail. Jerry has also whispered in Tom's ear on several occasions. <b>In Love Me, Love My Mouse Jerry calls Toots "Mama".</b>

<h2><center>History!</center></h2>
<hr>
<b>"Tom and Jerry"</b> was a commonplace phrase for young men given to drinking, gambling, and riotous living in 19th-century London, England. The term comes from Life in London; or, The Day and Night Scenes of Jerry Hawthorn, Esq., and his elegant friend, Corinthian Tom<b> (1821)</b> by Pierce Egan, the British sports journalist who also authored similar accounts compiled as Boxiana.However Brewer notes no more than an "unconscious" echo of the Regency era<b> (and thus Georgian era)</b> original in the naming of the cartoon.[10]
